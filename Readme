# Godot 4 C# - Game of Life

A implementation of Conway's Game of Life built with **Godot 4** and **C#**. 

## Features

* **Performance Rendering:** Uses GPU texture scaling instead of individual cell rendering.
* **Interactive Camera:** Smooth panning and zooming to navigate large simulation grids.
* **Built-in Patterns:** A wide selection of classic Game of Life patterns ready to be placed (Gliders, Pulsars, Spaceships, and more).
* **Simulation Controls:** Play, pause, step-by-step generation, and adjustable ticks-per-second (TPS).
* **Live Statistics:** Real-time tracking of generation count, population, and deaths/births.
* **Customization:** Change grid and active cell colors in real-time via the UI.

## Controls
